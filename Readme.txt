1.The code is used for asset management for a leverage manager
2.Exchange class is simplified just for tesing other class.I use nextDouble() method to simulate a real market price.
3.Order class and Strategy class are complemented for finishing Portfolio class and LeverageManager class.
4.I assume the functionality of Strategy class is only for initiating a portfolio.
5.I assume bothe the asset ID and order ID are String
